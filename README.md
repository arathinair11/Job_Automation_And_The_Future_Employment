We are experiencing rapid advancement of new technologies and an increasing adoption of automation in the United States. Although these smart automations have the potential to bring great economic benefits and generate new job opportunities, there is also a growing concern that it could displace many existing jobs in the US in next 10 - 15 years. This project intends to analyze how susceptible the existing jobs are to automation and what these shifts might mean for future employment.
