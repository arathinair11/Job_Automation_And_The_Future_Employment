## Job Automation And The Future Employment


### Introduction

Numerous studies have emerged claiming that AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation will displace US jobs in the coming 15 to 20 years. This digital revolution has unleashed a new wave of advanced machines, further automating complex tasks and jeopardizing skilled workers in positions once considered difficult to automate. Research increasingly shows that these disruptive technologies – predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, automation and robotics – are not only becoming better, but are also being combined to increase productivity and growth. This report highlights significant differences in the degree of automatability of jobs by industry sector.

The data for this analysis has been sourced from [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/educational-attainment.htm), [Mandeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/czbvhmzwm3/1) and [O*NET Data](https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/result/4.C.3.b.2)


### How susceptible are jobs to automation and what these shifts might mean for future employment?


### Automation in current workforce
We will first take a look at the adoption of automation in the existing US workforce. The graph below illustrates that the majority of the US workforce is increasingly adopting automation and newer technologies across all sectors. 23% of current jobs in the US are highly automated, 55.7% of the jobs fall into the morderate automation range, and only 23% of the jobs are least affected by automation.

Further examining the degree to which different job roles are automated, we observe that Top Executives, Scientists, Civil Engineers, Physicians, Therapists, Artists, Social Workers, Astronomists & Physicists jobs are largely confined to the low-risk category. Whereas the probability of job automation is seen to increase as jobs shift towards manual labor centric roles.

### Nature of job and job automation risk
In order to find out the major factors influencing the degree of automation for these jobs, we first compare the complexity of the jobs with its probability of automation. In the graph below, we see a clear inverse correlation between the complexity of job roles and the probability of job automation, indicating that less complex jobs are at higher risk of automation.

Similarly, routine intensive jobs which are governed by a clear set of steps or a process will make it easier for computers and machines to replicate, putting these jobs at a higher risk of displacement compared to non-routine jobs.

### Job automation risk by income
Now, to determine which segment of the US workforce is highly vulnerable to job displacement. We will evaluate the average salary earned by jobs with high probability of automation. The graph below shows a clear distinction between job wages and likelihood of job automation; low-wage jobs face higher probability of automation while higher-wage jobs are less prone to automation.

### Job automation risk by educational attainment
We will also analyze the level of education attained by jobs with high probability of automation. Although percentage of job automation risk for all education levels is moderate to low. Jobs requiring less educational attainment have higher percentage of automated jobs, indicating workers with higher educational attainment would be less vulnerable in the long run.

### Job aegments at risk
As a result, a large population of employees in the lower wage group with low education level are highly vulnerable to job displacement in the future. We also notice a few high paying jobs such as accountants, sales representatives and managers (general/service/operational) could also face job losses due to increased automation of repetitive tasks.

### Future employment growth
The future employment growth is likely to shift towards occupations like Healthcare, Social Service, Computer & Mathematical sectors which deal with non-routine tasks and require high cognitive skills and interpersonal skills. Whereas occupations like Production, Sales support, Farming & Agricultural sectors which are based on extensive routine task and follow explicit, systematic procedures will see a declined growth rate in the coming years.

### Conclusion
- As companies embrace and implement automation, the workforce will be elevated to more complex and creative job functions.
- More businesses will focus on integration of human centric and AI centric processes.
- Highly creative or technical positions are most likely to prevail which require cognitive skills, interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.
- Low-wage earners will be among the first to see their jobs disappear, since many of their tasks are routine based.
- Future workforce may need to switch occupations, acquire new skills and may also require to obtain higher educational qualifications.
- Moreover, the ongoing pandemic would force more businesses to speed up the job automation process. The labor-saving technologies could become permanent, displacing millions of jobs in the future.
